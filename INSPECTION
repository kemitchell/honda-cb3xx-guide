Inspecting a Honda CB350 or CB360

A would-be buyer's guide.

1.  Title and Registration

    A full mechanical and aesthetic inspection is worth nothing if
    you can't come away the legal owner of the motorcycle.

    1.  Ask the seller to show you the title and registration.

    2.  Check the VIN on the title against the VIN on the engine.

    3.  Check the VIN on the engine against the VIN on the frame.

    4.  Ask the seller to show you their driver's license.  Check their
        legal name against the name on the title and registration.

    5.  Check the title.  Is it titled in the state where you reside?
        Is it salvage title?

    6.  Check the registration date.  Is the registration currently
        valid?  Is the bike registered non-op?

2.  Front Wheel

    Check the front tire.  Ask the seller how old it is.

    Is the rubber brittle?  Check the tread.

    Check the rim.  Is it warped?  Any cracks?

    Check the spokes.  Tap each one with a screwdriver, wrench,
    or other tool.  Is each spoke under tension, emitting a tone
    when tapped?

    What kind of brake --- disc or drum?

    If it's a disc brake, is the disc warped?  Worn thin?  Ask how
    long ago pad was changed.  Check it.

    If it's a drum brake, check the linkage.  Ask if the shoes have
    been replaced.

X.  Extras

    Check the toolkit box, on the right side, under the side cover.

    Check the manual box under the seat for a manual.  You can find
    manuals for some revisions online, but the original is nice
    to have.
